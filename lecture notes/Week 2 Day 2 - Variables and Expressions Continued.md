Welcome back!

Today we'll continue exploring variables, and get some hands-on programming together.

---
### Announcements
- I recommend doing the LC after the Thursday session
- Has anyone tried starting the Project yet? 
- Any other questions/concerns/confusions?

---

### Rough gameplan
1. Review stuff from Day 1
2. Discuss variable naming, functions
3. Work on PCE for Expressions and Variables together
4. Discuss help-seeking template

---

### Review

---

Expressions are composed of at least one thing, and usually another thing. What are they?

---

Values and operators!

---

There are types of values, like `int` and `str` and this matters because...?

---

Values constrain our operators. 

For example, we can only do math with `int`, even if the number that is a `str` looks to us like a number.

---

### Short lecture on variables and a bit of functions

---

### Set up for PCEs

---

We're going to do this every Thursday, where we do a good chunk of programming together in class.

We will deliberately go slow, and deliberately *not* make our way through all of the exercises.

---

We will follow a pattern we call Struggle-Huddle-Model.

---

In the "Struggle" portion, we will have you attempt all or part of an exercise, for a bit. We call this struggle, because it's not unusual to not be able to solve the exercise on the first try. 

What we want to do is to understand where people are running into issues. The instructional team will go around collecting these things. If you get stuck, raise your hand and talk to us. Once we've got a few of these, we'll transition to the next step.

---

In the "Huddle" portion, we'll discuss as a class what we're running into, and then cycle through the issues and "Model" how to think about these issues and fix them.

---

We'll repeat this cycle until we get through roughly half of the exercises. Then you'll complete the rest on your own time!

---

Any questions?

If not, let's download the PCE file (it's on ELMS), fire up Jupyter, and get started!
