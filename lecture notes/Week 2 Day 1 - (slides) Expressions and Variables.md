I am going to archive lecture notes only on github as a forcing function. You can follow along there, but I recommend that you to download the notes and play with them (they are notebooks! :)).

Here's how to download them. 

---

1: Go to the file, then click on the "raw" button

You should see something like this.

It's JSON, btw. You'll probably be seeing a lot more of this file format :)

---

2: Right click and `save as`. Make sure you select `all files` as the file type, and that the filename ends with `.ipynb`.

Yes, this is annoying. But it gets you familiarize with github and filetypes, which are skills that will serve you well. 

There is also a less painful way to do this that requires learning github. I will later on provide an extra credit assignment for you to clone the repository and get the materials that way.

Alright, onto the lecture for today!
