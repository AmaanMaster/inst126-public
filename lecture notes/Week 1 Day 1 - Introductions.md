Welcome!

In this class, we will learn how to be a programmer.

---

Programming is the art of making computers do what we want with programs. 
 
---

A computer program is **a repeatable set of instructions that a computer can use to solve a class of problems**

---
Let's get an intuition for how this works.

Program me to stack these cups.

---

Can you think of a less laborious way to program to do the same task, using the same building blocks? 

*hint: Can you define new instructions based on these base instructions?*

---

Let's look at another example, in Python.

---

Aside: if you succeed, this is an example of what you *will* be able to do: take an English problem statement that is vague and high level, formulate it in computational terms, and then write a program like this.

---
Based on what we did, what observations can you make about what it's like to program computers?

---

One big observation: computers lack both the same common sense and world model that we have, and English. 

This means we can't instruct them to do things as simply as instructing another person: we have to really "dumb it down" and use very specialized and precise language, like a programming language

---

Critical mental model: programming skill is composed broadly of two things:
1. COMPUTATIONAL THINKING: how to model problems so they can be solved by computers
2) CODING: how to translate these models into valid instructions that a computer can follow

---

CODING tends to get all the attention. This is the syntax, the unfamiliarity of code language, should you learn Python or Javascript or C++ or Rust...

And this is important!

---

But COMPUTATIONAL THINKING is the foundation, without which you cannot be a programmer. 

Most real-world programmers will use that as a foundation and move from programming language to language, as the job requires.

---

Let's go back to the example code to explore how this maps to kinds of errors you'll make.

---

This is another critical mental model about two broad classes of errors:
- *Semantic errors*, which require COMPUTATIONAL THINKING fixes. Modeling the problem better.
- *Syntax errors*, which require CODING fixes. Writing the code correctly.

---

I want you to feel free to yell at the computer for syntax errors. You're learning how to talk to the computer in its ridiculously restrictive (but very precise) language.

---

You will also need to develop the skills to handle semantic and logic errors. Thinking more precisely about what you want to do, modeling the problem.

You'll learn concrete practices problem formulation and debugging, which we will discuss and practice together.

---

With all that as background, let's talk about how we will learn this together this semester.

---

And a brief word about your instructional team!

---

And a final note about materials: this slide deck (and subsequent lecture notes) will be archived on the course github page. 

---

Now let's spend some time initiating setup together! The goal is to get as far as we can into installing Anaconda and Jupyter to be able to open a Jupyter notebook.

If you're all set with this, you're free to go! Or you can stay to help a colleague. :) Otherwise, see you next class!
